# Online/Offline Budget Tracker

[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)
## Description 
  For this project, we needed to add functionality to an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. Using indexedDB, service workers and other functionality the application should cache the website, record transactions and then publish back to the mongoDB when online.

```
## User Story
